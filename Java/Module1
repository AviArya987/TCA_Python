# **📘 Module 1 — How a Computer Operates & Foundations of Programming**

Welcome to **Module 1** of the Java Cohort!
This README provides a **structured, visually rich learning path** with diagrams, icons, and well-formatted sections.

---

## 🧠 **1. How a Computer Operates**

### 🖥️ **1.1 What Happens Inside a Computer?**

A computer processes all data using the **IPO Cycle** (Input → Process → Output):

    B --> C[📤 Output]
```

## ⚙️ **2. Computer Architecture Overview**

### 🧩 **2.1 The Three Foundational Components**

    Storage((📦 Storage))

    CPU --> Memory
    Memory --> Storage
    Storage --> CPU
```

#### **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

* Executes instructions
* Handles arithmetic & logic operations
* Controls the entire system

#### **Memory (RAM)**

* Temporary workspace
* Extremely fast
* Volatile (data erased when powered off)

#### **Storage (SSD/HDD)**

* Permanent data storage
* Slower than RAM
* Holds OS, apps, files

---

## 🔢 **3. How Data Is Stored & Represented**

### 🧮 **3.1 Bits, Bytes & Binary**

> ⚡ Inside a computer, **everything is just 0s and 1s**.

```mermaid

    A[0️⃣ Bit → 1 or 0] --> B[💽 Byte → 8 bits]
    B --> C[📁 Kilobyte]
    C --> D[📦 Megabyte]
    D --> E[🧊 Gigabyte]
```

---

## 🧵 **4. How Programs Execute**

### 💡 **4.1 The Fetch–Decode–Execute Cycle**

Every processor runs this cycle **billions of times per second**:

```mermaid

    CPU->>Memory: 🔍 Fetch Instruction
    CPU->>CPU: 🧩 Decode Instruction
    CPU->>CPU: ⚡ Execute Instruction
```

---

## 🧩 **5. The Operating System (OS)**

The OS is the **bridge between hardware & applications**.

### 🔧 **5.1 Responsibilities of the OS**

* Process scheduling
* Memory allocation
* File system management
* Hardware communication
* Security & user permissions
* Networking

---

## 👨‍💻 **6. Programming Fundamentals**

### 🔤 **6.1 What Is Programming?**

> ✨ Programming is providing instructions to a computer in a language it understands.

### 🗂 **6.2 Types of Programming Languages**

#### Based on Level:

* **Low-Level:** Machine Code, Assembly
* **Mid-Level:** C
* **High-Level:** Java, Python, JavaScript

#### Based on Translation:

* **Compiled:** C, C++, Java (partially)
* **Interpreted:** Python, JavaScript
* **Hybrid:** Java (Compile + JVM interpretation)

## 🎯 **8. Structured Learning Path for Module 1**

1. How a computer works
2. CPU–Memory–Storage architecture
3. Binary & data representation
4. How programs execute
5. What programming really is
6. Types of languages
7. Compiled vs interpreted
8. OS role in execution flow
